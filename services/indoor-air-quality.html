                    <h1>Professional Indoor Air Quality Services in Castroville, TX</h1>
                    <img src="../images/mini-split-2.jpg" alt="Indoor air quality testing in Castroville TX" class="content-image image-right">
                    <p>Indoor air quality has become a critical concern for Castroville homeowners, especially given the amount of time families spend indoors. Poor indoor air quality can trigger allergies, worsen respiratory conditions, and impact overall health and comfort. Our comprehensive indoor air quality services provide advanced solutions to improve the air you breathe in your home, creating healthier, more comfortable living environments for you and your family.</p>
                    <p>Our expert technicians use state-of-the-art testing equipment and proven solutions to identify and address indoor air quality issues. From advanced filtration systems and air purifiers to humidity control and ventilation improvements, we offer comprehensive solutions that work seamlessly with your existing HVAC system to deliver cleaner, healthier indoor air.</p>
                    <h2>Comprehensive Air Quality Assessment</h2>
                    <p>Our indoor air quality services begin with a thorough assessment of your home's current air quality conditions. We test for common pollutants including dust, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other airborne contaminants that can affect health and comfort. This comprehensive evaluation allows us to recommend targeted solutions that address your specific air quality concerns.</p>
                    <img src="../images/mini-split-3.jpg" alt="Air quality testing equipment" class="content-image image-left">
                    <h3>Professional Air Quality Testing</h3>
                    <p>Using professional-grade testing equipment, we measure particulate levels, humidity, temperature, and other factors that affect indoor air quality. Our testing identifies specific pollutants and their sources, allowing us to develop customized solutions that effectively address your home's unique air quality challenges.</p>
                    <h3>Source Identification and Remediation</h3>
                    <p>Identifying the sources of indoor air pollutants is crucial for effective air quality improvement. Common sources include inadequate ventilation, dirty HVAC systems, moisture problems, chemical emissions from household products, and outdoor pollutants that infiltrate the home. We provide comprehensive source identification and remediation strategies that address root causes rather than just symptoms.</p>
                    <h2>Advanced Air Filtration Systems</h2>
                    <p>Modern air filtration technology offers powerful solutions for removing airborne pollutants from your home's air. We install and service various types of air filtration systems including high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, electronic air cleaners, and media filters that integrate seamlessly with your existing HVAC system.</p>
                    <h3>HEPA Filtration Systems</h3>
                    <img src="../images/mini-split-4.jpg" alt="HEPA filtration system installation" class="content-image image-center">
                    <p>HEPA filtration systems represent the gold standard for air purification, capturing 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. These systems are particularly effective for families with allergies or respiratory conditions, removing pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and other microscopic particles that trigger symptoms.</p>
                    <h3>Electronic Air Cleaners</h3>
                    <p>Electronic air cleaners use electrostatic precipitation to capture particles and pollutants. These systems are highly effective for removing both large and small particles and can be easily integrated into existing HVAC systems. They require minimal maintenance and provide long-term air quality improvements.</p>
                    <h2>Whole-Home Air Purification</h2>
                    <p>Whole-home air purification systems provide comprehensive air cleaning throughout your entire home. These systems work with your HVAC system to continuously clean and purify the air as it circulates, ensuring consistent air quality in every room.</p>
                    <h3>UV Light Air Purification</h3>
                    <p>Ultraviolet (UV) light air purification systems use germicidal UV lamps to neutralize bacteria, viruses, mold spores, and other biological contaminants. These systems are installed in your HVAC system and work continuously to eliminate harmful microorganisms that can cause illness or trigger allergic reactions.</p>
                    <h3>Photocatalytic Oxidation Systems</h3>
                    <p>Advanced photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) systems combine UV light with a catalytic surface to break down volatile organic compounds, odors, and other chemical pollutants. These systems are particularly effective for homes with chemical sensitivities or persistent odor problems.</p>
                    <h2>Humidity Control Solutions</h2>
                    <img src="../images/mini-split-1.jpg" alt="Humidity control system" class="content-image image-right">
                    <p>Proper humidity control is essential for indoor air quality and comfort. Texas's climate can create humidity challenges that affect both air quality and HVAC system performance. We provide whole-home humidification and dehumidification solutions that maintain optimal temperature extremes year-round.</p>
                    <h3>Whole-Home Dehumidification</h3>
                    <p>Excess humidity can promote mold growth, dust mite reproduction, and other air quality problems. Our whole-home dehumidification systems work with your HVAC system to maintain optimal temperature extremes, typically between 30-50% relative humidity, preventing moisture-related air quality issues while improving comfort.</p>
                    <h3>Humidification Systems</h3>
                    <p>During cooler months, low humidity can cause dry skin, respiratory irritation, and static electricity problems. Our whole-home humidification systems add the right amount of moisture to your indoor air, maintaining comfortable temperature extremes that support health and comfort.</p>
                    <h2>Ventilation Improvements</h2>
                    <p>Proper ventilation is crucial for maintaining good indoor air quality by bringing in fresh outdoor air and removing stale indoor air. We assess and improve home ventilation systems to ensure adequate air exchange rates that dilute indoor pollutants and maintain fresh, healthy indoor air.</p>
                    <h3>Energy Recovery Ventilation</h3>
                    <p>Energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) provide controlled ventilation while minimizing energy loss. These systems bring in fresh outdoor air while recovering energy from the outgoing stale air, maintaining good air quality without significantly increasing energy costs.</p>
                    <h3>Exhaust Ventilation Improvements</h3>
                    <p>Proper exhaust ventilation in kitchens, bathrooms, and other areas helps remove pollutants at their source. We install and service exhaust fans and ventilation systems that effectively remove moisture, odors, and pollutants before they can spread throughout your home.</p>
                    <h2>Ductwork Cleaning and Sealing</h2>
                    <p>Your HVAC ductwork can harbor dust, debris, and other contaminants that are then circulated throughout your home. Our professional ductwork cleaning and sealing services remove accumulated pollutants and prevent future contamination, significantly improving indoor air quality.</p>
                    <h3>Professional Duct Cleaning</h3>
                    <p>Using specialized equipment, we thoroughly clean ductwork to remove dust, debris, mold, and other contaminants. Professional duct cleaning can significantly improve air quality and HVAC system efficiency while reducing allergen levels throughout your home.</p>
                    <h3>Duct Sealing Services</h3>
                    <p>Leaky ductwork can allow pollutants to enter your air distribution system and can reduce system efficiency. Our duct sealing services identify and seal leaks, improving both air quality and energy efficiency while ensuring that conditioned air reaches its intended destination.</p>
                    <h2>Specialized Air Quality Solutions</h2>
                    <p>We offer specialized solutions for unique air quality challenges including pet odors, cooking odors, chemical sensitivities, and severe allergy concerns. Our customized approach ensures that each solution is tailored to your specific needs and lifestyle.</p>
                    <h3>Allergen Control Systems</h3>
                    <p>For families with severe allergies, we provide comprehensive allergen control solutions including high-efficiency filtration, regular system maintenance, and environmental modifications that significantly reduce allergen levels throughout the home.</p>
                    <h3>Odor Control Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Persistent odors can affect comfort and quality of life. Our odor control solutions include advanced filtration, ozone treatment, and source elimination strategies that effectively address even stubborn odor problems.</p>
                    <h2>Integration with Ductless Mini Split Systems</h2>
