                    <img src="../images/mini-split-3.jpg" alt="Air conditioning service technician in Castroville TX" class="content-image image-right">

                    <img src="../images/mini-split-1.jpg" alt="Air conditioning unit being serviced" class="content-image image-left">

                    <h3>Emergency Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
                    <p>Air conditioning emergencies don't wait for convenient times, and neither do we. Our 24/7 emergency AC repair service ensures that help is always available when your cooling system fails during the hottest days of summer. Our emergency technicians maintain fully stocked service vehicles with common replacement parts, allowing us to complete most AC repairs on the first visit even during off-hours.</p>

                    <p>Common emergency AC problems we address include complete system failures, refrigerant leaks causing poor cooling, frozen coils, compressor failures, electrical problems, and unusual noises indicating mechanical issues. Our priority during emergency calls is to restore cooling to your home as quickly as possible while ensuring all repairs meet safety standards and manufacturer specifications.</p>

                    <h3>Preventive Air Conditioning Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Regular maintenance is the key to reliable air conditioning performance, energy efficiency, and system longevity. Our comprehensive AC maintenance programs include thorough system inspections, cleaning of coils and components, filter replacement, refrigerant level checks, electrical connection tightening, and performance optimization.</p>

                    <p>During maintenance visits, our technicians also identify potential problems before they become costly repairs. This proactive approach helps prevent unexpected breakdowns during peak cooling season and ensures your system operates at maximum efficiency, reducing energy costs and extending equipment life.</p>

                    <h3>Air Conditioning Installation Services</h3>
                    <p>Whether you're building a new home, replacing an aging system, or adding cooling to previously unconditioned spaces, our AC installation services ensure you get the right system for your specific needs. We begin every installation project with a detailed load calculation and assessment of your property's unique requirements.</p>

                    <p>Our installation expertise covers traditional central air systems, ductless mini split installations, and hybrid systems that combine multiple technologies for optimal efficiency and performance. We work with you to select equipment that fits your budget, efficiency goals, and comfort preferences while ensuring proper sizing and installation for years of reliable operation.</p>

                    <h2>Common Air Conditioning Problems and Solutions</h2>
                    <img src="../images/mini-split-4.jpg" alt="AC diagnostic equipment being used" class="content-image image-center">

                    <h3>Poor Cooling Performance</h3>
                    <p>One of the most frequent complaints we address is inadequate cooling or uneven temperatures throughout the home. This problem can have multiple causes including dirty air filters, blocked vents, refrigerant leaks, dirty coils, oversized or undersized equipment, or ductwork problems. Our diagnostic approach identifies the specific cause and provides targeted solutions that restore proper cooling performance.</p>

                    <h3>High Energy Bills</h3>
                    <p>If your air conditioning costs have increased significantly, several factors could be contributing to the problem. Dirty coils reduce efficiency, low refrigerant levels force the system to work harder, worn components consume more energy, and poor system maintenance all contribute to higher operating costs. Our energy efficiency assessments identify these issues and provide cost-effective solutions.</p>

                    <h3>Frequent Cycling and Short Cycling</h3>
                    <p>Air conditioning systems that turn on and off frequently or run for very short periods indicate underlying problems that need professional attention. Common causes include oversized equipment, thermostat problems, refrigerant issues, or dirty components. This cycling problem not only affects comfort but also increases wear on system components and energy consumption.</p>

                    <h3>Refrigerant Leaks</h3>
                    <p>Refrigerant leaks are serious problems that require professional repair. Low refrigerant levels cause poor cooling performance, increased energy consumption, and potential compressor damage. Our technicians use electronic leak detectors and other specialized equipment to locate and repair refrigerant leaks, then properly recharge the system to manufacturer specifications.</p>

                    <h2>Energy Efficiency and Cost Savings</h2>
                    <p>Modern air conditioning systems offer significantly better energy efficiency than older units, and proper maintenance keeps them operating at peak performance. We help customers reduce cooling costs through equipment upgrades, system optimization, and maintenance programs that ensure maximum efficiency.</p>

                    <h3>SEER Ratings and Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>When replacing air conditioning equipment, we help customers understand SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) ratings and select systems that provide the best balance of efficiency and value for their specific situation. Higher SEER ratings mean lower operating costs, and modern systems often qualify for utility rebates and tax incentives that reduce installation costs.</p>

                    <h3>Smart Thermostat Integration</h3>
                    <p>Smart thermostats can significantly reduce air conditioning costs by optimizing system operation based on your schedule and preferences. We install and configure smart thermostats that learn your habits, adjust temperatures automatically, and provide detailed energy usage reports that help you optimize comfort and savings.</p>

                    <h2>Indoor Air Quality and Air Conditioning</h2>
                    <img src="../images/mini-split-2.jpg" alt="Air filtration system components" class="content-image image-right">

                    <p>Your air conditioning system plays a crucial role in maintaining indoor air quality throughout your home. We offer advanced filtration solutions, UV light systems, and humidity control options that work with your AC system to provide cleaner, healthier indoor air.</p>

                    <h3>Advanced Filtration Systems</h3>
                    <p>High-efficiency air filters remove dust, pollen, pet dander, and other airborne particles from your home's air. We offer various filtration options from basic pleated filters to advanced HEPA filtration systems that capture even microscopic particles. Our technicians can recommend the best filtration solution for your specific needs and air quality concerns.</p>

                    <h3>Humidity Control</h3>
                    <p>Texas's humid climate can make indoor spaces uncomfortable even when temperatures are properly controlled. We install and service whole-home dehumidification systems that work with your air conditioning to maintain optimal temperature extremes, improving comfort and preventing mold and mildew problems.</p>

                    <h2>Commercial Air Conditioning Services</h2>
                    <p>Our commercial air conditioning services keep businesses throughout Castroville comfortable and productive. We understand that commercial cooling needs are different from residential requirements, with larger systems, more complex controls, and the critical need for reliable operation during business hours.</p>

                    <p>Our commercial services include routine maintenance programs, emergency repair service, system replacements, and energy efficiency upgrades. We work with business owners to schedule service during off-hours whenever possible to minimize disruption to operations.</p>
